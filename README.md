# Euler-carmichael-checker
# 🔢 Euler's Theorem & Carmichael Number Checker

A mini Python project that checks whether a given number `n` satisfies **Euler’s Theorem** and also identifies if it is a **Carmichael number**.

## 📌 About the Project

This program demonstrates Euler’s theorem:

> If `gcd(a, n) = 1`, then `a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)`

It verifies this condition for all integers `a` that are coprime with `n`.  
Additionally, it checks whether `n` is a **Carmichael number** using a predefined list of known values.

## 🛠 Features

- ✅ Calculates **GCD** using the Euclidean Algorithm  
- ✅ Implements **Euler’s Totient Function (φ(n))**  
- ✅ Checks if a number is a **Carmichael number**  
- ✅ Verifies Euler’s theorem for all valid `a`  
- ✅ Simple and beginner-friendly Python code

## 🧪 Sample Output

For `n = 561`:
561 is a Carmichael number.
Euler's Theorem holds for n = 561
